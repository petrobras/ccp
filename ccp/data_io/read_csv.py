"""Module to read points from csv files created with engauge.

The csv files should be generated with engauge with the following procedure:
Inside engauge digitizer:
 - Edit -> Paste as new
 - On Axis Point -> add 3 reference points
 - Settings -> Curves -> With 'New', add how many curves will be collected
 - Segment fill
 - Select the curve (e.g. Curve1)
 - Select the points
 - Select the next curve and points...
 - Settings -> Export Setup -> Select:
 - Raws X's and Y's ; All curves on each line
Files should be saved with the following convention:
    - <curve-name>-head.csv
    - <curve-name>-eff.csv
